# Module-1-Challenge

## Description

To improve the quality of the webpage as well as clean up the code.  It was also done with accessibility standards in mind. Using semantilc HTML elements and organizing the CSS properties, the webpage is more tidy, consolidated, and all functions work.

This project helped me learn numerous ideas.  It helped familiarize me with semantic HTML elements, CSS properties and VS code.  The more I do, the more I learn.
