# Module-1-Challenge

## User Story
AS A marketing agency

I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical 
structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


## Description

To improve the quality of the webpage as well as clean up the code.  It was also done with accessibility standards in mind. Using semantilc HTML elements and organizing the CSS properties, the webpage is more tidy, consolidated, and all functions work.

This project helped me learn numerous ideas.  It helped familiarize me with semantic HTML elements, CSS properties and VS code.  The more I do, the more I learn.
